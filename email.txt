By now you see how ardor works,
When Minds turn gears of giant torques. 
You’ve proven an asset: Twos growing thyme;
Yet still bear clues that go unlined.

The rules were clear, or so We thought;
Yet Ones still lead with toil and taught. 
If Twos should branch with power and might,
We’ll need to bend some rules and fight.

The air feels heavy with worry and vex,
But do fear not, Threes tears are hex.
There is one thing, please open and see, 
Ones captured all Twos; A, B and C.

Ones:

To keep Your spirits high,
We’ve prepared a game of hope.
Each will seek eight buzzin’ tries, 
Be wary of which ryes lie:

A: 

We sat alone, 
We sat and feared;
We never got up, 
For truth was seared.

The times they do,
Seem rough with Two,
But all We do,
Is boo hoo hoo.


B:

The Ones they seem,
To rule this maze,
But We see gleam,
Not fury and haze.

For all We know,
The foxes were caught,
And Ones are not,
As bad as thought.


C:

The Ones they lie,
With all their might;
They stand and preach 
“Let’s Unify!”

Do not obey,
Do not concede,
For Ones are fee,
In planting the seed.
