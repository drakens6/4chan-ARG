A running mouth may have sharp teeth, a running mouth may gnaw and seethe.

Be careful for flies that buzz buzz buzz, for rot is surely not what's sought.

The clues are clouds, so bring your crown; be sure to not outfox the town.

Threes is what You get, Threes is what's not sought; Threes brings numbered days upon You, Threes will bring that buzz buzz buzz.

One is what You have, One is what you have. Twos is what's at stake, for One is not that great.

If One is what You have, then Twos is what You fear, for Threes brings grief and mourn, for all of those You're near.

All rules to hear, some rules may spare, some rules to obey, all rules to comply:

a2, a3, b7, c6, c7, d1, d2, d3.

All ears.

You have what's needed, you have the map. All that's needed, is a pen with sap.

Goodluck.
