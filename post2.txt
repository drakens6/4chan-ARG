Prongs were formed by fox at night, and the moon can’t light a path that bright;
[possible change of the location by op during the night]
So be wary of those that fork and fly, for the eyes of flies are many and sly.
[an area near bats? eyes of flies could mean multiple people watching the game?]

All you need will torches reveal, the Morse will show thee waxed with seal.
[torch= flashlight] [
Do not be led by those who wish, for color and symbol is what They fish.


What you seek is a surely might, a promise of time for those that fight.

The streets are paved with parsimonious need, but action to call is what will free.


Do not fear the end of roads, You still have time to mend Your code.

We know that oil can mask the maze, so here’s a little to mend your daze:


A village to rule, ought not be sought,
By One who is, with heart of rot.
If One is little, and Twos is big,
Then ordering might be, the tree with fig.

Stick eyes on gates, make sure to wait,
With patience and joint, You wait Your fate.
No phase nor sense, but a pace with pence,
And all you search will shine in birch.
All rules to hear, some rules may spare, some rules to obey, all rules to comply:

a2, a3, b7, c6, c7, d1, d2, d3.
a2, a3, b6, b7, c1, c3, d1, d2.

All ears.

You have what's needed, you have the map. All that's needed, is a pen with sap.
